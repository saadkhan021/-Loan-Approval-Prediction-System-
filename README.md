# -Loan-Approval-Prediction-System-
End-to-End Mini ML Project 
Project Title: Loan Approval Prediction System 
Goal: Build a complete ML solution from data cleaning to prediction. 
Dataset Suggestion: Loan Prediction Dataset 
Tasks: 
• Preprocess data (handle nulls, encode categories) 
• Train and test classification models 
• Save best model with joblib or pickle 
• Create a basic interface using Streamlit or CLI to input new data and show 
predictions 
Learning Focus: 
     ✔ End-to-end pipeline 
     ✔ Real-world prediction flow 
     ✔ Model saving and reuse
